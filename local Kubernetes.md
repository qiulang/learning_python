> Orchestration provides the following solutions:
>
> - A centralized tool for the distribution of applications across many machines.
> - Deploys new nodes when one goes down.
> - Relays information through a centralized API, communicating to every distributed node.
> - Efficient management of resources.
> - Distribution based on personalized configuration.

> The “perfect” local Kubernetes installation may differ based on your use case. If you are new to Kubernetes and want a gentle introduction, Docker Desktop will be a good first step. If you want a safe choice, minikube has been around the longest with lots of documentation. Finally, if multi-node setup is critical or if a small footprint is required, look to kind or k3s/k3d. Personally, I’ve been using minikube but looking to experiment with k3d in CI pipelines.

> To conclude, all these technologies are a good way to begin with Kubernetes. You just have to make a choice regarding your material and your objectives. But if I have to recommend one of them, I will go for Kubeadm. You may spend more time configuring your cluster but you will have a great overview of Kubernetes possibilities.
