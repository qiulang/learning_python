在SO 上一次不愉快的经历

[When a moderator is suspended, can the question closed by him/her be considered reopened again?](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/420767/when-a-moderator-is-suspended-can-the-question-closed-by-him-her-be-considered)

Why should it be reopened? Seems POB regardless of who closed it and what the status of their account is currently. -VLAZ

Moderator status is irrelevant, but the question is also currently locked, so you need to convince another moderator that the question is worthy to be unlocked and reopened. –

For starters, if the moderator is suspended for such a long time I guess he/she must have done something quite inappropriately, so can we trust the decision he/she made before ? –

@Qiulang I looked at the question with my eyes and saw it's POB. Therefore, I trust the decision to close it as POB. You seem to imply we shouldn't trust this decision, though. Why? What makes the question on-topic so that it requires reopening? Because surely you cannot solely base that on the account status of the closer. There is no real correlation there. If the user was suspeneded for closing this one question, then I'd expect staff would have also reopened the question, as well. – VLAZ

@VLAZ for that particular question I tend to agree it is opinion based so it was closed. But I was ask a general question that if the moderator is suspended for such a long time I guess he/she must have done something quite inappropriately, so can we trust the decision he/she made before ? – Qiulang


Again, I verified this decision is correct. What are you suggesting - undoing it even though it's correct? Your question cannot really have a blanket answer and I'm apprehensive why you're trying to push for one. – VLAZ


@Qiulang the big question is: if the suspension is related to moderation at all, and thus the actions need to be undone. It has happened on other SE sites, but not on this particular user. – Andrew T.

@VLAZ I told you for that particular question I agreed with the close decision. – Qiulang


@Qiulang yet you used it as an example. For the purpose of a blanket policy on reversing a suspended moderator's decisions. I really don't get the question, then - "Here is a question closed correctly but the account which closed it was suspended. Can this be reopened?" seems like a non-sequetur. What answer other than "No, it's correctly closed" did you expect? –VLAZ


@Qiulang ...I don't know what you're fishing for. The question was unilaterally closed by the moderator. And the decision is correct - I verified it, you also say you agree. So, should every decision be reversed? You literally gave the example to counter it. Can every decision be trusted? No, but that doesn't really change with suspension. You can disagree with any current moderator action right now - flag, or vote, or contact the site. Or you can even ping them in a comment to explain why you think it's wrong. I've had success with that approach. – VLAZ


So I guess you never experience the frustration of a question been closed or even deleted. Lucky for you but the frustration exists and is real, just google it. I quote an article here It’s time for Stack Overflow to address its moderation problems –Qiulang


"So I guess you never experience the frustration of a question been closed or even deleted." And that's relevant...how? Let me remind you yet again that the question you showcased was correctly closed. And you apparently agreed with this. And now somehow you want to...cure some sort of frustration? Of what, questions that are closed correctly and should be closed correctly? Surely, if you wanted to tackle incorrectly closed questions, you could have done that. Not call into question decisions by a suspended account and providing an example clearly showing they should not all be reversed. –VLAZ

If all this is a subtle way to discredit moderators and call for lowering of quality standards, then...well, not going to happen. If you have any point other than that, feel free to make it. –VLAZ


@qiulang frustration has many sources. For most people it will be that they do not understand Stack Overflow. That frustration does not form an argument for reopening or undeleting, it needs to be solved in different ways. –Gimby

"If all this is a subtle way to discredit moderators " No, not at all. But I see now you and I could never be on the same page. So I will stop. – Qiulang

"That is NOT my purpose." Your purpose becomes murkier with every update. Again, you agreed that the question you used as example should be closed. And yet you asked if it can be reopened. And more broadly, should all moderator decisions by the closer be reversed. Again, your example shows that no - such blanket reversal is unwarranted. You tried to appeal to general fear of this moderator's actions. Which again doesn't make sense. And now somehow you're trying to shoehorn in complaints over closures which is entirely unrelated to the moderator. How is that relevant to the point? – VLAZ

And now there is even more meta commentary completely irrelevant to the actions of a moderator. It feels less and less like an innocent question and more and more like a springboard to try and complain. About moderation in general, is what it seems like. This is quite frustrating to me but no - that's not what the question is about, is it?
